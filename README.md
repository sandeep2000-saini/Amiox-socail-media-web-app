I independently designed and developed a unique social media platform focused on card sharing and card collection instead of traditional follow systems. To collaborate, users must collect each otherâ€™s cards, which then appear on both profiles. The platform includes a custom user search feature like Snapchat, showing profile and area-based location while maintaining user privacy.
